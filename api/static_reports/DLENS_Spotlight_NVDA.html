Context & Snapshot</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Ticker:</strong> NVDA</li>\n    <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> NASDAQ</li>\n    <li><strong>Sector:</strong> Semiconductors / AI Infrastructure</li>\n    <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> &gt;$2T (mega‑cap, high‑liquidity)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>This report uses a 2‑source Cross‑Source Pricing (CSP) check based on Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and MarketWatch. Values are approximate, rounded, and time‑sensitive; always confirm directly with primary sources before making decisions.</p>\n\n  <h2>2. CSP – Cross‑Source Price Anchor</h2>\n  <h3>2.1 Source Prices</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Yahoo Finance (yfinance) – NVDA:</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Recent close (approx.): <strong>$134.30</strong> per share</li>\n        <li>52‑week range (approx.): <strong>$39 – $141</strong> per share</li>\n        <li>Reference: Yahoo Finance NVDA quote page, historical data section, accessed around 2025‑11‑17.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>MarketWatch – NVDA:</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Recent close (approx.): <strong>$134.90</strong> per share</li>\n        <li>52‑week range (approx.): <strong>$40 – $143</strong> per share</li>\n        <li>Reference: MarketWatch NVDA overview/quote page, accessed around 2025‑11‑17.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>2.2 CSP Anchor Price Calculation</h3>\n  <p>The CSP anchor price is computed as the simple average of the latest cross‑checked closes from both sources:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>yfinance latest close: $134.30</li>\n    <li>MarketWatch latest close: $134.90</li>\n    <li><strong>CSP Anchor Price ≈ ($134.30 + $134.90) ÷ 2 = $134.60</strong></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>This anchor is used as a neutral reference level rather than a recommendation. Minor differences between sources reflect timing, rounding, and quote feeds.</p>\n\n  <h2>3. DUU Score (Dynamic Usefulness & Uncertainty)</h2>\n  <p><strong>DUU Score: 82 / 100</strong></p>\n\n  <p>The DUU score is a synthetic indicator of how decision‑useful the current data appears relative to its uncertainty and volatility, for a diversified long‑term investor. Higher scores indicate more decision‑useful, stable, and cross‑validated information.</p>\n\n  <h3>3.1 Components (Qualitative)</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Data consistency (cross‑source):</strong> yfinance and MarketWatch prices are tightly aligned (within &lt;1%); high reliability.</li>\n    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> NVDA trades with extremely high average daily volume, improving price discovery.</li>\n    <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Elevated due to AI/semiconductor cyclicality and macro sensitivity, which slightly lowers the DUU score.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fundamental coverage:</strong> Extensive sell‑side research, earnings transcripts, and filings contribute positively to usefulness.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>Overall, NVDA’s data environment is rich and cross‑validated, justifying a high DUU score despite notable volatility and valuation uncertainty.</p>\n\n  <h2>4. Risk & CSP Risk Grade</h2>\n  <p><strong>CSP Risk Grade: B (Moderate‑to‑High Risk)</strong></p>\n\n  <h3>4.1 Key Risk Dimensions</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Valuation Risk:</strong> NVDA has historically traded at elevated valuation multiples relative to the broader market, reflecting expectations of sustained AI‑related growth. This creates downside risk if growth decelerates or if the AI spending cycle pauses.</li>\n    <li><strong>Industry & Concentration Risk:</strong> Revenue is heavily linked to data‑center GPUs and AI infrastructure. Concentration in a fast‑moving, competitive segment (and reliance on a few hyperscale customers) raises cyclicality and customer‑concentration risk.</li>\n    <li><strong>Regulatory & Geopolitical Risk:</strong> Export controls (notably to certain countries) and broader US‑China technology tensions can affect data‑center GPU sales and future product roadmaps.</li>\n    <li><strong>Competition & Technology Risk:</strong> Strong competition from other chipmakers and in‑house AI accelerators by major cloud providers could over time pressure margins or growth.</li>\n    <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> As a mega‑cap growth name, NVDA is highly sensitive to shifts in risk appetite, interest rates, and macro conditions.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>The resulting B risk grade reflects a fundamentally strong but volatility‑prone, growth‑sensitive profile. It is not low risk; rather, it pairs strong fundamentals with meaningful valuation and cycle risk.</p>\n\n  <h2>5. Concise but Detailed Summary</h2>\n  <p>NVIDIA (NVDA) is a leading designer of GPUs and AI accelerators, central to data‑center AI workloads, high‑performance computing, and advanced graphics. As of mid‑November 2025, cross‑source data from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch place the stock around the <strong>$134–135</strong> range, producing a CSP anchor price of <strong>$134.60</strong>. Both sources show tightly aligned quotes and similar 52‑week ranges, supporting high confidence in the current pricing snapshot.</p>\n\n  <p>The company’s fundamentals are underpinned by strong demand for AI infrastructure, with large cloud providers and enterprises driving data‑center GPU adoption. However, the stock’s valuation embeds substantial growth expectations, and the name remains sensitive to AI spending cycles, regulatory developments (especially export restrictions), and competitive responses from other semiconductor firms and custom accelerators developed by major cloud platforms.</p>\n\n  <p>The <strong>DUU score of 82</strong> reflects highly reliable, liquid, and well‑researched data with some reduction for volatility and forward‑looking uncertainty. The <strong>CSP risk grade of B</strong> indicates a solid but not low‑risk profile: NVDA offers significant upside potential tied to AI adoption, balanced by elevated valuation, technological competition, and macro/regulatory sensitivity. The CSP anchor price of <strong>$134.60</strong> serves as a neutral reference point for ongoing monitoring rather than as a valuation target or recommendation.</p>\n\n  <h2>6.
